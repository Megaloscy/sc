Complete the core modular system:

Addon dependency management

Addon hot-reloading

Addon version compatibility

Event system for addon communication

Add networking for multiplayer:

WebSocket server implementation

Client-server architecture

Synchronization

Lag compensation

Expand gameplay features:

Unit movement and pathfinding

Building construction

Current Code Summary to Copy:
Make sure to copy your working .htaccess content and mention that it's working. Also share any key configurations that made it work.

What to Ask for Specifically:
"Based on my working XAMPP setup with fixed ES6 modules, I want to:

Complete the modular addon system with proper dependency handling

Add WebSocket multiplayer support

Implement a complete RTS gameplay loop

Add multiple races with unique units and buildings

Create an AI that can play against human players

Please help me expand the current working codebase."

This will give the next chat session the context needed to continue building your modular RTS game without re-solving the XAMPP module issue.
